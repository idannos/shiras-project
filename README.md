**sending image to server from website**


you can edit the data that going back to the client. you can lower the image quality for sending bigger images (from the user before sending).

*this is really bad architecture (wrote it fast from what I remember), but it works for small images. I guess this fits for your school project.*

# how to run it:
copy the server.py and index.html to the same pycharm project -> than run the server, if needed give permissions etc -> open chrome browser -> type 127.0.0.1 in the url area. now you sould connect to the server and receive the website. than insert small (!!!) image and test if it sent to the server. I recommand starting with little paint draw for testing. If you want I can help with sending bigger images.
